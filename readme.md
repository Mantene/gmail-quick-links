# Gmail Quick Links

A Chrome Extension / Firefox Add-on to replace the existing Gmail Quick Links currently found in
Gmail Experimental Labs.  As of 3/24/2017, Google will be [retiring](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/03/updates-in-g-suite-to-streamline-hangouts-and-gmail.html) the Gmail Experimental Labs soon.

You could run this extension alongside the original Dan P. Gmail Labs extension, but you'll need to toggle between the gadget pages in gmail to see this extension.  If you have existing gmail labs loaded, you'll find the gadget page toggle in the lower left navigation pane that looks like a three dots.
