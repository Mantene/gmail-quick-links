# Gmail Quick Links

A Chrome Extension / Firefox Add-on to replace the existing Gmail Quick Links
currently found in Gmail Experimental Labs that Google is
[retiring](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/03/updates-in-g-suite-to-streamline-hangouts-and-gmail.html).

Supports multiple logged-in gmail accounts, with ability to create quick links
that work across all logged-in accounts or a quick link that is specific to one
account.

Icons come from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icon/12610/add-link-filled). Please
use them, they're great.

### Background

As of 3/24/2017, Google will be retiring the Gmail Experimental Labs soon.

You could run this extension alongside the original Dan P. Gmail Labs extension,
but you'll need to toggle between the gadget pages in gmail to see this
extension. If you have existing gmail labs loaded, you'll find the gadget page
toggle in the lower left navigation pane that looks like a three dots.
